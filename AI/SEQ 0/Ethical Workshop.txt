In small groups (6 students), applying the methods proposed in the previous video, think about your response to an ethical issue proposed by your tutor. (duration: 15 minutes)

You can choose a subject that closely affects them: 

The Student Council is organising a party and, 1 week before, they are told that the venue will not be available due to a technical problem. The Student Council can only find 2 venues available in the vicinity: one 50 km away, which could accommodate everyone, and one closer, but which could not.
