# Employee Attrition Prediction & Analysis

## Abstract

This project addresses the critical issue of employee attrition at HumanForYou by developing a robust predictive framework utilizing machine learning. Various models, including **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM**, were evaluated based on performance metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**. Among these, the **Random Forest** model emerged as the most reliable predictor of attrition. The insights derived from this model informed a series of proposed solutions aimed at reducing turnover, including targeted retention strategies, improved hiring practices, continuous monitoring, and data-driven policy formulation. This integrated approach equips HumanForYou with the tools to enhance employee engagement and foster long-term organizational success.
