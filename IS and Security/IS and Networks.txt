27.11.24
-> hashing is different than encryption
-> importance of integrity in CIA triad
-> you use hashing in integrity 
-> type of hashing = MD5
-> RAID systems = technique to have redundant servers for backup and recovery
-> Syn attack = synchronous message sender and asynchronous message receiver
-> Port mirroring (in IDS)
-> directory traversal attack

For the workshop:
-> Active Directory (fundamentals)
-> GPO
-> AAA [authorisation, authentication, accounting]
-> symmetric and asymmetric encryption + certificates and signatures

-> DAC vs RBAC vs MAC
